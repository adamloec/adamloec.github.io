## About

I created this project in the process re-learning the basics to machine learning. This repository showcases the usage of a handful of common ML concepts and models.

### Readings, resources, and design inspirations

- Machine Learning Specialization coursework - Andrew Ng

## Goals

1. Further solidify my applicational knowledge of basic ML concepts.
2. Develop a pipeline with feature engineering.
3. Future: Add matplot visualization to view results comparing models?
